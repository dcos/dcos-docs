# DC/OS Documentation 

The DC/OS documentation source has moved here: https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-docs-site. DC/OS documentation has been [merged with DC/OS Enterprise documentation](https://mesosphere.com/blog/dcos-documentation/) at [https://docs.mesosphere.com](https://docs.mesosphere.com). Community contributions to the open source documentation site have been really valuable, and it was important to us that the new documentation remained open source. We anticipate that, with our teamâ€™s focus on a single documentation site, we will be much faster at reviewing PRs. Existing PRs will be migrated to the new site. For information on how to contribute, see [Contributing](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-docs-site/wiki/Contributing).
