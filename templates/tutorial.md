Explain XXX in a paragraph or two: what it is in a nutshell (a database, a query engine, etc.) and what can you use it for.
If there are official docs, such as from Apache, please reference them here.

**Time Estimate**:

How long will it take to complete this tutorial?

**Target Audience**:

Who is this for? Will it talk about setting XXX up for development or something that is HA? Example:

- Operators
- Highly-Available
- Automated Administration

**Terminology**:

This is an optional section, allowing you to define and explain concepts used in XXX, useful especially for people who are not that familiar with XXX.

**Scope**:

Define what this tutorial covers (what one will learn in it).

# Table of Contents

# Prerequisites

List out all the things that should be done first, with links to how you do them. The cluster size required should ALWAYS be here. Example:

- [Install](../install/README.md)
- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- Cluster Size - [Check Cluster Size](../getting-started/cluster-size)

# STEP 1 (What is the summary for this step?, usually installation is step 1)

Explain the usage of XXX. Screen shots and detailed command line instructions are highly encouraged. There is an outline that should be used for each step:

- Walk through the sub-steps required.
- For every step, include the script (or whatever assets, eg. marathon.json) required to run it. The user should be able to execute each script entirely from the directory.
- Link to an in-depth overview that explains the implementation details covered in this step (packaging system, two level scheduler, ....)
- Provide a "Success" step. For every step, the user should be able to verify what happened during this step. This should end up looking behind the covers at what's actually happening on the cluster instead of just using it.

# STEP 2

As above.

# Cleanup

Make sure to provide cleanup steps so that the cluster goes back to the state that it was in originally.

# Appendix: Next Steps

Provide the user with somewhere to go when they're done here. Some examples:

- [Debugging](../debugging/README.md)
- [Operating](../operating/README.md)
- [API Documentation]()
