# Prerequisites
In order to get started with this tutorial, you should have access to a running DC/OS OSS cluster and the DC/OS CLI installed and configured.
Furthermore, you have just deployed app2 in our cluster and have verified it is running.

# Objective
In this section we will make app2 available from outside the cluster by running it on a public agent node with marathon-lb.


# Steps
DC/OS has two different node types: private and public agent nodes. Private agent nodes (usually) do not have ingress access from outside of the cluster, while public agent nodes allow for ingress access from outside the cluster.

By default, marathon starts applications and services on private agent nodes, which cannot be accessed from the outside the cluster. To expose an app to the outside we usually use a load-balancer running on one of the public nodes. We will revisit the topic of load-balancing (and different choices for load-balancers) later in this tutorial, but for now, we choose marathon-lb as our load-balancer.

  * Install marathon-lb: `dcos package install marathon-lb`
  * Check that it is running: `dcos task` and identify the IP adress of the public agent node (Host) where marathon-lb is running on,
    * Warning: If you started your cluster using a cloud provider (especially AWS) dcos task might show you the private ip address of the host, which is not resolvable from outside the cluster (e.g., if you see something like 10.0.4.8 it is very likely a private address).
    In that case, you need to retrieve the public IP from your cloud provider. On AWS, go to the console and then search for the instance with the private IP shown by 'dcos task'. The public IP will be listed in the instance description as Public IP.
  * Connect to the webapp (from your local machine) via `<Public IP>:10000`. You should see a rendered version of the web page including the physical node and port app2 is running on.
  * Use the web form to add a new Key:Value pair
  * Let us verify the new key was actually added to redis
    * Check the total number of keys using app1: `dcos task log app1`
    * Check redis directly
      * SSH into node where redis is running: `dcos node ssh --master-proxy --mesos-id=$(dcos task  redis --json |  jq -r '.[] | .slave_id')`
       * NOTE: This requires you to have the key required to ssh to the machines added to your local ssh agent (e.g., via ssh-add key).
       * As redis is running in docker container let us list all docker container `docker ps` and get the ContainerID.
       * Connect to a bash session to the running container: `sudo docker exec -i -t CONTAINER_ID  /bin/bash`
       * Start the redis CLI: `redis-cli`
       * Check value is there: `get <newkey>`

# Outcome
Congratulations! You've used marathon-lb to expose your application to the public and added a new key to redis using the web frontend.
