# <a name="universe"></a> Mesosphere Universe

[Universe][1] is the DC/OS package repository that contains services like Spark, Cassandra, Jenkins, and many others. At their simplest, DC/OS packages are bundled containerized apps that can be deployed onto a cluster. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit a package to Universe. Some packages are "selected" by Mesosphere and are identified as such in the DC/OS UI and DC/OS CLI.

All services in the Universe are required to meet a standard as defined by the DC/OS project team. For details on publishing a release of a DC/OS service, see [Publish a Package][2] in the Universe documentation.

For detailed information about the JSON files of a package, see the [Universe][1] docs.
