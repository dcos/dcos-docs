# Challenge
So we scale-our app, how does that effect the way I can access it?



# Steps
  The problem is that we have public and private agent nodes. Services and apps run by default on the private ones. EXPLAIN WHY.


  * Install marathon-lb `dcos package install marathon-lb`
  * Check that it is running via `dcos task` and identify the public node it running on
  * Check webapp on `publicNode:10000`

  Note that we will explain the
  EXPLAIN SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE AND WHY WE NEED ELB IN FRONT.

# Outcome
 We understood how apps can be found in the cluster.

# Deep Dive
        * Tradeoffs in service discovery
            * When to use which method for service discovery
            * Enumerate all MesosDNS tasks: `curl -s -f http://master.mesos:8123/v1/enumerate`
