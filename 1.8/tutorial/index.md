This DC/OS 101 tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to get started using DC/OS.

The tutorial is designed to provide users and applications developers an overview of the basic pieces of DC/OS. We will discuss basic recipes for developing developing and orchestrating applications for a distributed landscape. In order to provide hand-on experience we will develop and deploy multiple applications (including stateful, containerized and non-containerized applications) on an actual cluster during each step of the tutorial. To provide even more rationale and background information the tutorial also includes optional deep dives into relevant topics.
