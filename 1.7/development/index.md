## <a name="universe"></a>Package Repositories

In DC/OS, the [Universe][1] contains packages that are installable as services in a cluster. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit a package to Universe. Some packages are "selected" by Mesosphere and are identified as such in the DC/OS UI and DC/OS CLI.

All services in the Universe are required to meet a standard as defined by the DC/OS project team. For details on publishing a release of a DC/OS service, see [Publish a Package][2] in the Universe documentation.

For detailed information about the JSON files of a package, see the [Universe][1] docs.

## <a name="dcos-integration"></a>DC/OS Integration

When creating DC/OS Service there are several integration points that can be leveraged. The sections below provide detailed explanations on how to integrate with each respective component.

### <a name="adminrouter"></a>Admin Router

When a DC/OS Service is installed and ran on DC/OS, the service is generally deployed on a [private agent node][3]. To allow users to access a running instance of the service, Admin Router can functions as a reverse proxy for the DC/OS Service.

Admin Router currently supports only one reverse proxy destination.

To allow Admin Router to function as a reverse proxy for the DC/OS Service one of the following methods should be used

#### Framework Web UI URL

If the DC/OS Service will register with Mesos as a framework, the `webui_url` framework property may be specified and will be used by Admin Router to proxy requests to the service.

* The URL must NOT end with a forward slash (/). For example, this is good `internal.dcos.host.name:10000`, and this is bad `internal.dcos.host.name:10000/`.

Since the paths to resources for clients connecting to Admin Router will differ from those paths the Service actually has, ensure the Service is friendly to running behind a proxy. This often means relative paths are preferred to absolute paths. In particular, resources expected to be used by a UI should be verified to work through a proxy.

When the `webui_url` is provided, a link to the service will be available from the DC/OS UI. The link will be generated based on a convention of: `/service/<service_name>`. For example, `<dcos_host>/service/unicorn` is the proxy to the `webui_url`.

### <a name="dcos-ui"></a>DC/OS UI

Service health check information can be surfaced in the DC/OS services UI tab by:

1. Defining one or more healthChecks in the Service's Marathon template, for example:

        "healthChecks": [
            {
                "path": "/",
                "portIndex": 1,
                "protocol": "HTTP",
                "gracePeriodSeconds": 5,
                "intervalSeconds": 60,
                "timeoutSeconds": 10,
                "maxConsecutiveFailures": 3
            }
        ]

2. Defining the label `DCOS_PACKAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME` in the Service's Marathon template, with the same value that will be used when the framework registers with Mesos. For example:

         "labels": {
            "DCOS_PACKAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME": "unicorn"
          }

3. Setting `.framework` to true in `package.json`

### <a name="cli-subcommand"></a>CLI Subcommand

If you would like to publish a DC/OS CLI Subcommand for use with your service it is common to have the Subcommand communicate with the running Service by sending HTTP requests through Admin Router to the Service.

See [dcos-helloworld][6] for an example on how to develop a CLI Subcommand.

## Package Guidelines

The following are a set of guidelines that should be considered when creating a DC/OS Package.

### `package.json`

* Focus the description on the service. Assume that all users are familiar with DC/OS and Mesos.
* The `tags` parameter is used for user searches (`dcos package search <criteria>`). Add tags that distinguish the service in some way. Avoid the following terms: Mesos, Mesosphere, DC/OS, and datacenter. For example, the unicorns service could have: `"tags": ["rainbows", "mythical"]`.
* The `preInstallNotes` parameter gives the user information they'll need before starting the installation process. For example, you could explain what the resource requirements are for the service: `"preInstallNotes": "Unicorns take 7 nodes with 1 core each and 1TB of ram."`
* The `postInstallNotes` parameter gives the user information they'll need after the installation. Focus on providing a documentation URL, a tutorial, or both. For example: `"postInstallNotes": "Thank you for installing the Unicorn service.\n\n\tDocumentation: http://<service-url>\n\tIssues: https://github.com/"`
* The `postUninstallNotes` parameter gives the user information they'll need after an uninstall. For example, further cleanup before reinstalling again and a link to the details. A common issue is cleaning up ZooKeeper entries. For example: `postUninstallNotes": "The Unicorn DC/OS Service has been uninstalled and will no longer run.\nPlease follow the instructions at http://<service-URL> to clean up any persisted state" }`
