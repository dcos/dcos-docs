DC/OS cluster nodes generate logs that contain diagnostic and status information for DC/OS core components and DC/OS services. There are two different types of logs in DC/OS. Each of them is managed differently.

## Service and Task Logs

If you're running a service on top of DC/OS, get started right away by running the CLI command listed below. For more in-depth documents on background and more methods of getting access to your logs, see [service and task logs][1].

```bash
$ dcos task log --follow my-service-name
```

Consult the [CLI installation documentation][2] if youâ€™re not already running the CLI.

## System Logs

For most use cases, you are interested in the logs for unhealthy components. These can be found in the DC/OS UI under `System`.

You can also aggregate your system logs. Take a look at our [ELK][3] and [Splunk][4] tutorials for more information.

All the DC/OS components use journald to store their logs. [SSH into a node][5] abd run the following command see them:

```bash
$ journalctl -u "dcos-*" -b
```
