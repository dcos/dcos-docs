DC/OS is comprised of many individual open source components that are precisely configured to work together. 

You can log into any host in the DC/OS cluster and view the currently running services by inspecting the `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants/` directory. 

You can view the DC/OS component details in the <a href="https://github.com/dcos/dcos/">https://github.com/dcos/dcos/</a> repo in the packages directory.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admin Router Agent</td>
    <td>This component (<code>dcos-adminrouter-agent</code>)is a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server that lists all of the agent nodes in your cluster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admin Router Master</td>
    <td>This component is a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server that lists all of the master nodes in your cluster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admin Router Reloader</td>
    <td>This component (`dcos-adminrouter-reload.service`) restarts the Admin Router Nginx server so that it can pick up new DNS resolutions, for example `master.mesos` and `leader.mesos`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admin Router Reloader Timer</td>
    <td>This component (`dcos-adminrouter-reload.timer`) sets the Admin Router Reloader interval at once per hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Admin Router Service</td>
      <td>This component is an open-source Nginx configuration created by Mesosphere that provides central authentication and proxy to DC/OS services within the cluster. The Admin Router service (`dcos-adminrouter.service `) is the core internal load balancer for DC/OS. Admin Router is a customized <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">Nginx</a> that proxies all of the internal services on port `80`.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cluster ID</td>
    <td>The cluster-id service generates a universally unique identifier (UUID) for each cluster. We use this ID to track cluster health remotely (if enabled). This remote tracking allows our support team to better assist our customers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Diagnostics</td>
    <td><p>This component (`dcos-3dt.service`) is the diagnostics utility for DC/OS systemd components. This service runs on every host, tracking the internal state of the systemd unit. The service runs in two modes: with or without the `-pull` argument. If running on a master host, it executes `/opt/mesosphere/bin/3dt -pull`, which queries Mesos-DNS for a list of known masters in the cluster, then queries a master (usually itself) `:5050/statesummary` and gets a list of agents.</p><p>From this complete list of cluster hosts, it queries all 3DT health endpoints (`:1050/system/health/v1/health`). This endpoint returns health state for the DC/OS systemd units on that host. The master 3DT processes, along with doing this aggregation, also expose `/system/health/v1/` endpoints to feed this data by `unit` or `node` IP to the DC/OS user interface.</p></td>
