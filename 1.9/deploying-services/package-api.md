You can install DC/OS services by using the Package Management API. DC/OS services are installed from packages that are stored in a package registry, such as the [Mesosphere Universe](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesosphere-universe).

The [DC/OS Package Manager (Cosmos) component](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/#dcos-package-manager) runs on all master nodes.

For information about managing package repositories, see [Managing Package Repositories](/docs/1.9/administering-clusters/repo/).

For information about managing services, see [Managing Services](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/).

|-------|----------|

| `/package/` | `/package/` |
| `/capabilities` | `/capabilities` |
