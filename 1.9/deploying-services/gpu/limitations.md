# Limitations

- Unlike other resources, like  CPUs, memory, and disk, you can only specify whole numbers of GPUs in your application definition. If a fractional amount is selected, launching the task will result in a `TASK_ERROR`.

- Nvidia GPU support is only available for tasks launched through the [DC/OS Universal container runtime](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/containerizers/). No support exists for launching GPU-capable tasks through the Docker containerizer. However, the DC/OS Universal container runtime supports running Docker images natively.

- While GPU resources are advertised to the Mesos master alongside other resources like CPUs, memory, and disk, the master will only forward offers that contain GPUs to DC/OS services that have explicitly enabled the GPU_RESOURCES capability. Below is an example of setting this capability in a C++-based service.
  ```c++
    FrameworkInfo framework;
  framework.add_capabilities()->set_type(
        FrameworkInfo::Capability::GPU_RESOURCES);

  GpuScheduler scheduler;

  driver = new MesosSchedulerDriver(
      &scheduler,
      framework,
      127.0.0.1:5050);

  driver->run();
  ```
