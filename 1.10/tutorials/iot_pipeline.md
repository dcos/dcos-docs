In this tutorial, a containerized Ruby on Rails app named Tweeter is installed and deployed using DC/OS. Tweeter is an app similar to Twitter that you can use to post 140-character messages to the internet. Then, you use Zeppelin and Spark to perform real-time analytics on the data created by Tweeter.

Tweeter:

*   Stores tweets in the DC/OS [Cassandra][1] service.
*   Streams tweets to the DC/OS [Kafka][2] service in real-time.
*   Performs real-time analytics with the DC/OS [Spark][3] and [Zeppelin][4] services.

This tutorial uses DC/OS to launch and deploy these microservices to your cluster.

- The Cassandra database is used on the backend to store the Tweeter app data.
- The Kafka publish-subscribe message service receives tweets from Cassandra and routes them to Zeppelin for real-time analytics.
- The [Marathon load balancer (Marathon-LB)][12] is an HAProxy based load balancer for Marathon only. It is useful when you require external routing or layer 7 load balancing features.
- Zeppelin is an interactive analytics notebook that works with DC/OS Spark on the backend to enable interactive analytics and visualization. Because it's possible for Spark and Zeppelin to consume all of your cluster resources, you must specify a maximum number of cores for the Zeppelin service.

This tutorial demonstrates how you can build a complete IoT pipeline on DC/OS in about 15 minutes! You will learn:

*   How to install DC/OS services.
*   How to add apps to DC/OS Marathon.
*   How to route apps to the public node with the [Marathon load balancer][5].
*   How your apps are discovered.
*   How to scale your apps.

**Prerequisites:**

*  [DC/OS](/docs/1.10/installing/) installed with at least 5 [private agents][6] and 1 [public agent][6].
*  [DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.10/cli/install/) installed.
*  The public IP address of your public agent node. After you have installed DC/OS with a public agent node declared, you can [navigate to the public IP address][9] of your public agent node.
*   Git:
    *   **macOS:** Get the installer from [Git downloads](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).
    *   **Unix/Linux:** See these [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

# Install the DC/OS services
From the DC/OS web interface [**Catalog**](/docs/1.10/gui/#catalog) tab, install Cassandra, Kafka, Marathon-LB, and Zeppelin.

__Tip:__ You can also install DC/OS packages from the DC/OS CLI with the [`dcos package install`][11] command.

1.  Find and click the **cassandra** package, click the **DEPLOY** button, and accept the default installation. Cassandra spins up to 3 nodes. Click **GO TO SERVICE**.
1.  Click the **Catalog** tab. Find and click the **kafka** package and click the **DEPLOY** button. Kafka spins up 3 brokers. Click **GO TO SERVICE**.
1.  Click the **Catalog** tab. Find and click the **marathon-lb** package and click the **DEPLOY** button.
1.  Click the **Catalog** tab. Click the **zeppelin** package and click the **CONFIGURE** button.
    1.  Click the **spark** tab and set `cores_max` to `8`.
    1.  Click **REVIEW AND DEPLOY** and click **DEPLOY**. Click **GO TO SERVICE**.
1.  Click the **Services** tab to watch as your microservices are deployed on DC/OS. You will see the Health status go from Idle to Unhealthy, and finally to Healthy as the nodes come online. This may take several minutes.

    **Tip:** It can take up to 10 minutes for Cassandra to initialize with DC/OS because of race conditions.

# Deploy the containerized app

In this step you deploy the containerized Tweeter app to a public node.

1.  Navigate to the [Tweeter](https://github.com/mesosphere/tweeter/) GitHub repository and save the `/tweeter/tweeter.json` Marathon app definition file.

1.  Add the `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` definition with the public IP address of your [public agent][9] node to your `tweeter.json` file.

    **Important:** You must remove the leading `http://` and the trailing `/`.

    ```json
    ...
      ],
      "labels": {
        "HAPROXY_GROUP": "external",
        "HAPROXY_0_VHOST": "<public-agent-IP>"
      }
    ...
    ```

    In this example, a DC/OS cluster is running on AWS:

    ```bash
    ...
      ],
      "labels": {
        "HAPROXY_GROUP": "external",
        "HAPROXY_0_VHOST": "joel-ent-publicsl-e7wjol669l9f-741498241.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
      }
    ...
    ```

4.  Install and deploy Tweeter to your DC/OS cluster.

    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add tweeter.json
    ```

    **Tip:** The `instances` parameter in `tweeter.json` specifies the number of app instances. Use the following command to scale your app up or down:

    ```bash
    dcos marathon app update tweeter instances=<number_of_desired_instances>
    ```

    The service talks to Cassandra via `node-0.cassandra.mesos:9042`, and Kafka via `broker-0.kafka.mesos:9557` in this example. Traffic is routed via Marathon-LB because of the `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` definition in the `tweeter.json` app definition file.

1.  Go to the **Services** tab to verify your app is up and healthy.

    ![Tweeter deployed](/docs/1.10/img/tweeter-services7.png)

1.  Navigate to [public agent][9] node endpoint to see the Tweeter UI and post a tweet.

    ![Tweeter][14]

# Post 100K Tweets

Deploy the post-tweets containerized app to see DC/OS load balancing in action. This app automatically posts a large number of tweets from Shakespeare. The app will post more than 100k tweets one by one, so you'll see them coming in steadily when you refresh the page.

1.  Navigate to the [Tweeter](https://github.com/mesosphere/tweeter/) GitHub repository and save the `tweeter/post-tweets.json` Marathon app definition file.

1.  Deploy the `post-tweets.json` Marathon app definition file.

    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add post-tweets.json
    ```

1.  After the `post-tweets.json` is running:

    *  Refresh your browser to see the incoming Shakespeare tweets.

       ![Shakespeare tweets](/docs/1.10/img/tweeter-shakespeare.png)

The post-tweets app works by streaming to the VIP `1.1.1.1:30000`. This address is declared in the `cmd` parameter of the `post-tweets.json` app definition.

```json

  "id": "/post-tweets",
  "cmd": "bin/tweet shakespeare-tweets.json http://1.1.1.1:30000",
...
```

The Tweeter app uses the service discovery and load balancer service that is installed on every DC/OS node. This address is defined in the `tweeter.json` definition `VIP_0`.

```bash
...
  "containerPort": 3000,
  "hostPort": 0,
  "servicePort": 10000,
  "labels": {
    "VIP_0": "1.1.1.1:30000"
}
...
```

# Add Streaming Analytics

Next, you'll perform real-time analytics on the stream of tweets coming in from Kafka.

1.  Navigate to Zeppelin at `https://<master_ip>/service/zeppelin/`, click **Import Note** and import `tweeter-analytics.json`. Zeppelin is preconfigured to execute Spark jobs on the DC/OS cluster, so there is no further configuration or setup required. Be sure to use `https://`, not `http://`.

    **Tip:** Your master IP address is the URL of the DC/OS web interface.

2.  Navigate to **Notebook** > **Tweeter Analytics**.

3.  Run the **Load Dependencies** step to load the required libraries into Zeppelin.

4.  Run the **Spark Streaming** step, which reads the tweet stream from ZooKeeper and puts them into a temporary table that can be queried using SparkSQL.

5.  Run the **Top tweeters** SQL query, which counts the number of tweets per user using the table created in the previous step. The table updates continuously as new tweets come in, so re-running the query will produce a different result every time.
