The Logging API exposes node, component, and container (task) logs.

The Logging API is backed by the [DC/OS Log component](/docs/1.10/overview/architecture/components/#dcos-log), which runs on all nodes in the cluster.

For more information about using the Logging API, see [Logging](/docs/1.10/monitoring/logging/).

For usage examples, see [Logging API Examples](/docs/1.10/monitoring/logging/logging-api-examples/).


# Compatibility

The Logging API was added in DC/OS 1.9.0. Prior to DC/OS 1.9.0, all node, component, and container logs were managed by Logrotate. In DC/OS 1.9.0 and higher, node and component logs are managed by journald. However, by default the Mesos task journald log sink is disabled due to [journald performance issues](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5102). Container log files are accessible via the [Mesos task sandbox files API](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/sandbox/#via-the-files-endpoint).

If you want to enable the task journald log sink, configure [mesos_container_log_sink](/1.10/installing/custom/configuration/configuration-parameters/#mesos_container_log_sink) at installation time. 

# Routes

Access to the Logging API is proxied through the Admin Router on each node using the following route:

```
/system/v1/logs/v1/
```

Access to the Logging API of the agent nodes is also proxied through the master nodes:

```
/system/v1/agent/{agent_id}/logs/v1/
```

To determine the address of your cluster, see [Cluster Access](/docs/1.10/api/access/).


# Format

The API request header can be any the following:

- `text/plain`, `text/html`, `*/*` request logs in text format, ending with `\n`.
- `application/json` request logs in JSON format.
- `text/event-stream` request logs in Server-Sent-Events format.


# Resources

The following resources are available under both of the above routes:
